## 9 Best practices for structuring Python projects
When you look for advice online about how to organize and write your Python code, you will find a lot of different ideas. But really, it comes down to a few basic things.

1. **Organize your code**
Properly organizing your code is crucial when working on a Python project. You can start by creating separate folders for different parts of the project, such as one for the code itself, one for data, one for testing, and one for project documentation. This way to structure will help you find what you need more quickly and make it easier for others to navigate your code.

2. **Use consistent naming**
It's important to use consistent names for files and folders throughout your project. Try to follow conventions like using underscores for variables and functions and capital letters for classes. This will make it easier to read and understand your code.

3. **Use version control**
Even when working alone, using a tool like Git to keep track of changes to your code is a recommended best practice. It allows you to keep a record of your changes and easily back up your work to a cloud-based repository. Most cloud-based Git solutions offer a free tier for solo practitioners.

4. **Use a package manager**
Using a package manager like pip to manage dependencies will help you install and keep track of all the different pieces of software your project needs to run. This is especially important when working with large projects with many dependencies.

5. **Create virtual environments**
To keep your Python project isolated from other projects on your computer, you can use a virtual environment. A virtual environment will prevent conflicts between packages used in different projects.

6. **Comment your code**
Adding comments to explain what your code is doing and how to use it is important for making your code more accessible to others. It also helps you remember what you were thinking when you wrote the code.

7. **Test, test, test**
Using automated tests to check that your code works as expected is essential for catching bugs early on. This will save you time and prevent issues down the line.

8. **Lint and Style**
Using a tool like Ruff or Flake8 to make sure your code looks consistent and catch common mistakes will help you write better code. These tools check your code for consistency with PEP 8, the official Python style guide. You can also use a tool like Black to ensure that your code looks the same across your project. This will help you maintain consistency and make it easier to read and understand your code.

9. **Package to share**
Using a tool like setuptools to package and distribute your Python code will make it easier to share your work with others. This will also help ensure that others can use your code without encountering any issues.
