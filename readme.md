### Why AoC Manager?

$project will solve your problem of where to start with documentation,
by providing a basic explanation of how to do it easily.

A lot of people will come to your docs trying to figure out what exactly your project is. Someone will mention it, or they’ll google a phrase randomly. You should explain what your project does and why it exists. [Fabric](http://docs.fabfile.org/) does a great job of this.

### Features

### Installation Instructions

Install $project by running:

```python
    install project
```

### How to Use AoC Manager

Look how easy it is to use:

```python
    import project
    # Get your stuff done
    project.do_stuff()
```
